# Changelog

Changes can be:
* 🌟⭐️💫 features
* 🐞🐜 friendly or nasty bugs
* 🛠 dev improvements

## 0.4.316 (2021-12-21)
* 💫 Add option to control opening of built static app (@filipesilva, #31)
* 🐜 Fix path error on windows by bumping markdown dep (#34)
* 🐞 Fix browse in `build-static-app!` on windows (#39)

## 0.4.305 (2021-12-13)
* 🌟 Support markdown as an alternative to Clojure source code for prose-heavy documents.
* 🌟 Changed viewer api: Added a `:transform-fn` that allows a transformation of a value in JVM Clojure. Also rename `:fn` to `:render-fn` for clarify and ensure the `:pred` only runs on JVM Clojure to enable using predicates that cannot run in sci in the browser. Add support for serving arbitrary blobs  via a `:fetch-fn` that returns a map with `:nextjournal/content-type` and `nextjournal/value` keys ([example](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/blob/8ad88630f746f1a9ff3ac314f5528c2d25c42583/notebooks/viewers/image.clj)).
* 🌟 Added `v/clerk-eval` to the viewer api which takes a quoted form and evaluates it in the context of the document namespace.
* ⭐️ Allow setting code cell & result visibility via
  `:nextjournal.clerk/visibility` metadata on a form. Valid values are: `:show` (default) `:fold` or `:hide`. These settings can be set on individual forms, setting them on the `ns` form changes the default for all forms in the document. If you want to affect only the `ns` form, use  `:fold-ns` or `:hide-ns` ([example](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk/blob/8ad88630f746f1a9ff3ac314f5528c2d25c42583/notebooks/visibility.clj)).
* 💫 Added a dynamic binding `config/*in-clerk*` that is only true when Clerk is driving evaluation.
* 💫 Persist viewer expansion state across document reloads and make document updates minimize repaints and flickering.
* 💫 Keep document scroll position when an error is shown by moving error into overlay.
* 💫 Wrap sci context in an atom to let consumers change it.
* 💫 Exclude Emacs lock files from being shown via file watcher #22 (@ikappaki)
* 💫 Add viewers for Clojure vars and a catch all `pr-str` viewer
* 🐜 Don't cache uncountable values within `*bounded-count-limit*` #15.
* 🐞 Prevent infinite loop when calling `show!` in a notebook using `config/*in-clerk*`.

* 🐜 Fix error in describe when sorting sets of maps
* 🐜 Fix arity exception when running table viewer predicates
* 🐞 Restore page size of 20 for seqs
* 🐞 Fix regression in closing parens assignment
* 🛠 Automate github releases


## 0.3.220 (2021-11-09)
